A game build with elastic technology
1. Add strain visualization
2. Add shaking ground
3. Merge texture with deformable meshes
4. Self collision


# Key technique
1. optimization speed consideration
	1. parallel
2. Solve differential eq
	1. euler method
	2. implicit


# experiments
1. different parameters
2. different triangles mesh (dense vs sparse)

# Process



# Findings
1. forget to add self collision
2. Beside numerical simulation, visualization / rendering is important
3. Possible combination with generative AI

# Future work
1. 3D
